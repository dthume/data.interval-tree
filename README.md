# Interval Treeset

This is a fork of [dthume's
data.interval-tree](https://github.com/dthume/data.interval-tree), purely to
support newer versions of Clojure. It looks like David might be AFK for a bit;
hopefully he'll come back and this can go away!

I've changed the project name (for Clojars), but left the namespaces under
org.dthume; it should be a drop-in replacement for the original.

## About

Interval Treeset built on [data.finger-tree](https://github.com/clojure/data.finger-tree).

Largely based on the implementation described in the
[original paper](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/publications/FingerTrees.pdf).

## Basic Usage

For a full set of examples, see the walkthrough.

```clojure
;; just for this documentation
(require '[org.dthume.data.interval-treeset :as it])
```

Interval Treesets sort their entries by _interval_. Intervals are simply pairs
of values, and you can use vectors to represent them:

```clojure
[5 10] ; the interval 5 - 10
```

However you may find it convienient to use the `interval` function which
produces an optimised (but still compatible) interval:

```clojure
(it/interval 5 10)
;; => [5 10]
```

This uses [clj-tuple](https://github.com/ztellman/clj-tuple) to
represent the pair.

Treesets can be created using `interval-treeset`. Because treesets take a
number of (optional) configuration options, there is no constructor which
takes items to populate the initial treeset with such as
`clojure.core/vector`. Instead treesets are created using `interval-treeset`
and then filled using `into`:

```clojure
(def ts (into (it/interval-treeset) [[0 2] [3 5] [6 8]]))
;; => ([0 2] [3 5] [6 8])
```

If you wish to store something other than raw intervals in the set, then
provide an interval lensing function:

```clojure
(def cts (into (it/interval-treeset :as-interval :span)
               [{:span [6 8] :id 3} {:span [3 5] :id 2} {:span [0 2] :id 1}]))
;; => ({:span [0 2] :id 1} {:span [3 5] :id 2} {:span [6 8] :id 3})
```

Items will be added at the correct position:

```clojure
(conj ts [1 4]) ;; Amortized O(log(n))
;; => ([0 2] [1 4] [3 5] [6 8])

(count ts) ;; O(1)
;; => 3

(first ts) ;; Amortized O(1)
;; => [0 2]

(peek ts)  ;; Amortized O(1)
;; => [6 8]

(nth ts 1) ;; O(log(n))
;; => [3 5]
```

## Selections

```clojure
(require '[org.dthume.data.interval-treeset.selection :as sel)
```

You should probably _not_ attempt to `use` or `(require ... :refer :all)` the
selection namespace, since it contains vars which shadow `clojure.core`.

## TODO

- Confirm union correct wrt paper.
- Confirm complexity of intersection / difference
- Customize print-method to print as set rather than seq?
